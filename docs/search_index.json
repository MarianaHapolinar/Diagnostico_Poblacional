El objetivo es tener una apreciación de los parametros más importante para definir un cierto patrón o interacciones. Por concequencia la base de todo estudios is based on the fundamewntal units of data collection. If the data do not represent the reality of the study then the interperettion of the analysis is likely to be erroneous. Fancy mathematics and analyses will NOT result in better or more realistic interpretation if the data is erroneous. In this section we will consider different aspects of population projection matrix analises and different aspects of the data collection or analysis which are problematic. For each of the problematic situation I will show an example and how it impacts the results and analyses. These “Impacts” are not meant to be inclusive of all possible results of non-sensical data, but an example of not considering these issues and how it may warp the intepretations. Thus a warning to all population biologist to be weary of these issues. 21.1 Small sample size or rare events Without a doubt the main topic (although exclusive) for the use of PPM has been to evaluate population projection of rare or endangered species (ref). Consequently, sample size of the study or some of the life stages/ages are reduced. These reduced sample size cause parameter estimates and often non-sensical results. 21.1.1 No Mortality/Perfect survivorship Consider a species were data is collected and the transition matrix (Sp1matU) is as follows and fertility matriz is (Sp1matF). Note that none of the individuals died in the adult stage (perfect survivorship). Consiquently, the population size never decreases or increases after a time period. Under ALL biologically realistic modelling we would expect populaiton size to sdtart decreasing if a population has no receuitment. library(DiagrammeR) Sp1matU &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.5, 0.3, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.4, 1.0) ) # transition matrix Sp1matF &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) # fertility matrix Sp1matA = Sp1matU+Sp1matF # TF matrix library(Rage) stages &lt;- c(&quot;plantula&quot;, &quot;juvenil&quot;, &quot;adulto&quot;) plot_life_cycle(Sp1matU, stages=stages, fontsize = 0) Thus if we analize this matrix we assume that none of the individuals in the adult stage die, at any time period!!!. Clearly this is not realistic. For any species the likelyhood of death at any stage is never zero (although is could very small) and thus our matrix is non-sensicle. Consider a tree species, such a Sequoia, it is the likely for large trees of this species it is likely to that survivorship is very high, however never 100%. In the following script we show that population changes after 5 -6 periods reminds close to one and does not change eventhough we have not recruits (we use the transition matrix without fertility). If there are no recruits (fertility matrix) population size should reduce with time. n=c(5,5,5) library(popdemo) ## Welcome to popdemo!

Note the life cycle figure where no arrows connect juveniles to adults. library(DiagrammeR) Sp1matU_NT &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.5, 0.7, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.995) ) # transition matrix Sp1matF &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) # fertility matrix Sp1matA_NT = Sp1matU_NT+Sp1matF # TF matrix library(Rage) stages &lt;- c(&quot;plantula&quot;, &quot;juvenil&quot;, &quot;adulto&quot;) plot_life_cycle(Sp1matU_NT, stages=stages, fontsize = 0) As shown by Caswell (2000) and more recently explored by Stott et al. (2010) matrices need to be irreducible. The concept of irreducibility is associated with the life cycle of the species and the matrix includes the transitions from all stages to all other stages. The above life cycle figure is missing two important components in the life history of the species, no juveniles grow to become adults and none of the adults produce seedlings (seeds that grow to seedlings). An easy way of determining if the matrix is irreducible is to read the follwowing script isIrreducible in the package (popdemo). Note that is this case the result is False for the above matrix. isIrreducible(Sp1matU_NT) # for the transiiton matrix, missing a transition stage and fertility ## [1] FALSE isIrreducible(Sp1matA_NT) # for the TF matrix, missing a transition stage ## [1] FALSE # Now considering Sp1matA_2 isIrreducible(Sp1matA_2) # includes all transitions and fertility ## [1] TRUE 21.1.3 No survivorship Complete mortality of one or more stages. It is often observed that survivorship of smaller individuals or the first stage of the life cycle of a species is highly risky, where the likelihood of survbivorship is very low. For example, most seeds do not survive to germinate. This is likely the norm in orchids where seed production is very high (sometimes millions seeds in one seed capsule, i.e Catasetum; ref), but few are shown to germinate (ref). However this is not limited to orchids, in trees the same pattern may be observed, for example in Nothofagus pumilio seedling recruitment was less than 1.5% Torres et al. (2015). NEED EXAMPLE OF NO SEED OR SEEDLING RECRUITMENTS. As it is well known that seed germination in orchids is less than straightforward and many variables may influence seed germination Rasmussen et al. (2015). ……. In the present life cycle graph, none of the seedling survive or growth to the next stage. Note the first column in the transition matrix all values are zero. The population may have started with many (even thousands) of seedling, but none grew to become a juvenile or remained as seedlings. This results in a matrix that is reducible isIrreducible = FALSE and consequently does not comply with the requirements needed. library(DiagrammeR) Sp1matU_NS &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.7, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.25, 0.995) ) # transition matrix Sp1matF &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) # fertility matrix Sp1matA_NS = Sp1matU_NS+Sp1matF # TF matrix library(Rage) stages &lt;- c(&quot;plantula&quot;, &quot;juvenil&quot;, &quot;adulto&quot;) plot_life_cycle(Sp1matU_NS, stages=stages, fontsize = 0) isIrreducible(Sp1matU_NS) ## [1] FALSE 21.2 Fertility estimates and life cycle The importance of considering how fertility included in the life cycle is extremely important, and if erroneously considered may result in results and interpretation that are non-sensicle. We would show a few example of how these can be included in the life cycle and matrix and result in cause problems. 21.2.1 Incorrect life cycle and fertility stage Assume you have a species where you model the life cycle as seedling, juvenile and adult. Fertility is measured as the number of seeds produced by an adult (mean number of seeds per adult). After collecting the data calculations it is determined that the mean number of seeds per adult is 11000. If we add this the transition and fertility matrix belowand evaluate the lambda and graph the population growth with the function project we have a lambda of 4.93 and after only 5 time periods the number of adults are above 250,000. Consequently the population growth rate estimeste would be incorrect and misleading. The error is that the value in the fertility matrix should correspond to the first stage of the matrix, in this case the seedling stage. Thus the top right corner of the fertility matrix should not be the mean number of seeds per plant, but the mean number of seedlings produced by a an adult plant. library(DiagrammeR) Sp1matU_Fert &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.3, 0.7, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.25, 0.995) ) # transition matrix Sp1matF &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 1100.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) # fertility matrix Sp1matA_Fert = Sp1matU_Fert+Sp1matF # TF matrix library(Rage) stages &lt;- c(&quot;plantula&quot;, &quot;juvenil&quot;, &quot;adulto&quot;) lambda(Sp1matA_Fert) ## [1] 4.937718 # show change in population size n ## [1] 5 5 5 pr &lt;- project(Sp1matA_Fert, vector=&quot;n&quot;, time=5) plot(pr) # Note that even after just 5 time periods, the number of adults is larger than 250,000 individuals If we wish to add a seed stage than we have to include the stage in our model and matrix with a new stage the seed stage. library(DiagrammeR) Sp1matU_Fert2 &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.995) ) # transition matrix Sp1matF2 &lt;- rbind( c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1100.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ) # fertility matrix Sp1matA_Fert2 = Sp1matU_Fert2+Sp1matF2 # TF matrix library(Rage) stages &lt;- c(&quot;semillas&quot;, &quot;plantula&quot;, &quot;juvenil&quot;, &quot;adulto&quot;) plot_life_cycle(Sp1matA_Fert2, stages=stages) lambda(Sp1matA_Fert2) ## [1] 1.019805 # show change in population size pr &lt;- project(Sp1matA_Fert2, vector=&quot;n&quot;, time=5) plot(pr) # Note that now the number of adults did not increase to the level of the previous model 21.3 Data Analysis issues 21.3.1 Incorrect confidence intervals estimates Confidence intervals of transtion, stasis survivorship based on normal distribution Dirichlet approach for estimating confidence intervals References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
